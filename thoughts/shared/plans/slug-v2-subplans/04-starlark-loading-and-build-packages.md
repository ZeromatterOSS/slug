# Stage 4: Starlark Loading and BUILD Packages

## Goal

Load and evaluate Bazel `BUILD.bazel` and `.bzl` files with starlark-rust,
using Bazel globals and package semantics rather than Buck loading semantics.

## Scope

- `load()` resolution through Bazel labels and repo mappings.
- `package()`, `exports_files`, `glob`, `subpackages`, visibility defaults,
  and package groups.
- `rule(implementation=...)` registration.
- Bazel `attr.*` surface.
- native module behavior for Bazel 9+.
- `.bzl` initialization caching through DICE.

## DICE Rule

Map Bazel's Skyframe restart behavior to explicit async DICE dependencies. If
a Starlark-visible method needs label resolution, file reads, repo mapping, or
repository materialization, route that through a named DICE key or async bridge
before returning the Starlark-visible value.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Small `BUILD.bazel` packages load under V2 and match Bazel oracle output.
- `.bzl` load graphs invalidate when loaded files change.
- No BUCK/TARGETS file discovery remains in the V2 loading path.
- Error shapes are close enough for modern rulesets and exact where tests
  require exactness.

## Validation

```bash
cargo test -p slug_loading_v2
slug-v2-oracle run --fixture build-file-loading
slug-v2-oracle run --fixture bzl-load-invalidation
```
