## Checkpoint Evidence

### Stage 5 registry source.json digest substrate

Status: Partially landed
V2 commit: Pending checkpoint on `codex/slugv2-clean-root-remediation`
V1 source inspected: None for implementation; existing Stage 5 source.json parser behavior remains grounded by the prior V1-reference ledger entry
Bazel oracle: Bazel 9.1.1 `registry-source-json-policy` fixture using a workspace-local registry and `bazel mod graph`
V2 fixture: `registry-source-json-policy`
Expected evidence artifact: Existing Stage 1 oracle expected output for valid, missing-url, missing-integrity, and invalid-json source.json cases
Implementation summary: Added explicit registry `source.json` digest identity beside registry MODULE.bazel digests: `BzlmodRegistrySourceSpecDigest`, deterministic `digest_registry_source_specs`, ordered source-spec selection that preserves first-registry wins plus source.json content digests, selected-source digest aggregation, and a `registry_sources=` component in `BzlmodDiceInputs`; no downloader, archive extractor, patch applier, repository materializer, lockfile writer, or V1 registry client was imported
Validation: `cargo fmt -p slug_bzlmod_v2`; `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=.codex-cargo-target CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=1 cargo test -p slug_bzlmod_v2`; `py -3 -B -m tools.v2_oracle run --fixture registry-source-json-policy --tool bazel --bazel C:\ProgramData\chocolatey\bin\bazel.exe --timeout 120`; bundled `pytest -q -p no:cacheprovider tests/v2_oracle/test_v2_oracle.py`; Stage 5 guardrail grep and diff checks before commit
Residual risk: `source.json` digests are now modeled for semantic invalidation, but fetch/extract/patch behavior, registry hash enforcement, visible/hidden lockfile replay, and repository materialization remain later Stage 5.2/5.5/5.6 work
