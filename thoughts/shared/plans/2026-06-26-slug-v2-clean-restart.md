# Slug V2 Clean-Restart Implementation Plan

## Canonical Status

This plan owns milestone priority and acceptance state. The
[current packet](./slug-v2-subplans/current-packet.md) owns the one active
contract; stage plans own subsystem invariants and future acceptance gates.
The orchestration skill owns execution/recovery, and the
[authoring guide](./slug-v2-plan-authoring-guide.md) owns packet readiness.
Historical evidence is indexed in [plan-history.md](./plan-history.md) and
never selects work. This compaction changes no accepted compatibility surface.

## Live Status

| Milestone | Status | Accepted boundary / remaining gate |
|---|---|---|
| M0: archive and baseline | accepted | V1 archive refs and clean-root baseline in `9897e940`; keep archive identities |
| M1: one semantic spine | accepted | shared daemon DICE, immutable requests/observations/source certificates, atomic publication, overlapping isolation and warm reuse; historical acceptance inventory in plan-history |
| M2: analysis graph | accepted, Slug-native identity | recursive configured graph; exact configuration/output bytes remain M9 |
| M3: query | accepted | 16 default functions and admitted text formats, including `attr()` through `ed38f82a`; Sky Query/non-text breadth deferred |
| M4: cquery | accepted | shared configured graph, structural/null identity, admitted topology/formats, error and daemon lifecycle behavior |
| M5: aquery | accepted, bounded FileWrite | owner-complete configured graph and admitted literal/deps output; per-family ActionKey fields have independent exact/Slug-native/deferred classifications |
| M6: execution/caching | accepted, bounded FileWrite | sole resolved semantic input, canonical REAPI SHA-256, selected platform and daemon restoration; zero direct-local actions |
| M7A: bootstrap-critical breadth | partial; current milestone | authentic configured fixture, combined selected-request/conflict acceptance, execution groups and only the remaining bootstrap closure capabilities |
| M8: bootstrap | blocked on M7A | Bazel developer graph and BuildBuddy cache/RBE gates accepted; CI not admitted; Stage 10.3/10.4 self-hosting remains unproved |
| Cache library release | deferred until M8 | Stage 11 standalone Rust consumer, remote AC/CAS and Bazel disk-cache interoperability; bootstrap establishes the shared core |
| M7B: remaining breadth | deferred until M8; mixed-language repository follows cache library release | run/test/BEP, unrelated rulesets, extra formats and product extensions not demanded by bootstrap |
| M9: exact identity/inspection bytes | deferred until functional bootstrap | retain four-domain evidence `f00e99db`; exact configuration/output bytes and unadmitted exact ActionKey projections |

### Current packet

Packet: WP-7A-authentic-protobuf-payload
Status: ready

Add the exact demand-established protobuf 33.4 archive and notice to the
authentic offline fixture, as specified by
[current-packet.md](./slug-v2-subplans/current-packet.md). The bounded diagnostic
chain is accepted and identifies this payload while reading protobuf's routed
`REPO.bazel`; F1 remains partial until the unchanged proof names its successor.

Normal run registry propagation is accepted at `47163df7b`, typed registration
error identity at `a06f3ddfc`, bounded observer at `64c7d2475`, and source
observation diagnostics at `ac6140f41`. Their old implementation checkpoints
are historical, not pending work. Observer results remain inconclusive; no
source-demand, performance, or historical memory attribution is inferred.

The complete selected-request/output-conflict R2 candidate remains unaccepted.
It is durably preserved at `27e9e9c0c` on `review/output-conflict-r2`, based on
`97dffd5d4`, with original patch and validation receipt in `review-evidence/`.
Preservation is not integration. Do not activate it partially or weaken a gate.

### Ready and blocked queue

| Order | Result | State / dependency |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Authentic protobuf 33.4 payload | ready; routed diagnostic accepted and same F3 run now names the pinned selected-registry archive while reading `REPO.bazel` |
| 2 | Authentic configured CLI fixture | F2 accepted; F1/F3 blocked on the causal diagnostic and any demand or semantic owner it names; [fixture ledger](./slug-v2-subplans/configured-cli-fixture.md) owns the receipt |
| 3 | Combined selected-request/output-conflict R2 | blocked on complete fixture and outstanding baseline attribution; [Stage 6](./slug-v2-subplans/06-analysis-toolchains-and-actions.md) owns semantics and gate ledger |
| 4 | Bootstrap-demanded execution-group support | blocked on R2; reconcile existing closure artifacts and record named/automatic demand before freezing scope; reuse Stage 6's pinned source matrix |
| 5 | Remaining M7A action/input-tree/REAPI capabilities and shared cache core | select demanded rows in [bootstrap readiness](./slug-v2-subplans/bootstrap-readiness.md); Stage 11 owns the library boundary |
| 6 | Stage 10.3 graph comparison, then 10.4 fixed point | blocked on finite M7A closure; use reviewed typed comparison contract |
| 7 | Standalone remote/disk cache library | blocked on M8; [Stage 11](./slug-v2-subplans/11-bazel-compatible-cache-library.md) owns release gates |
| 8 | M7B mixed-language/command breadth, then M9 exact identity/inspection | separate functional ruleset and exact projection admission |

Tests retain the user's 12-second deadline/15-second absolute ceiling.
Compile/preparation is separate and bounded to 60 seconds; split/check smaller
units when necessary. An unattributed timeout is not a semantic failure.
Cumulative path-epoch fanout remains a separate measured concern: the recorded
retry 116 recomputed 109 path keys and checked 163 module/192 registry keys.
It is not evidence of a semantic loop or authority for checkout-wide replay.

## Non-Negotiables

- Bazel 9 only. No pre-Bazel-9 behavior, no WORKSPACE support, and no legacy
  toolchain-resolution compatibility.
- Bazel source and Bazel tests are the compliance oracle. A parity claim needs
  a local Bazel source citation or an oracle fixture result.
- DICE owns semantic build state. Do not hide semantic discovery inside
  synchronous Starlark-visible APIs.
- REAPI is the execution boundary. BuildBuddy is the primary scaled remote
  development/CI lane; sibling `../actiond` is the preferred hermetic local
  conformance backend; NativeLink remains a useful regression backend. All sit
  behind the same REAPI boundary.
- Bazel invocations may use ordinary RC discovery and consume the user's
  `~/.bazelrc` for BuildBuddy authentication. Agents and inspection tools must
  never read or copy its contents, and credentials or derived secret material
  must never enter this checkout, logs intended for commit, or Git history.
- Slug-local sandbox implementation is deferred until after analysis, admitted
  `aquery` semantics, remote execution, and cache correctness. Backend isolation supplied
  by BuildBuddy or actiond does not count as a Slug sandbox implementation.
- Progress is demonstrated by a vertical Bazel-shaped build, not by independent
  identity, parser, DICE-shaped, action, or REAPI data models. A wrapper trait
  or stable-serialization helper is scaffolding until the owner fixture drives
  it through the real runtime boundary.
- V2 output layout targets Bazel-shaped paths. Any deliberate Slug-specific
  divergence must be explicitly documented as an extension, not assumed.
- V1 plans and code are evidence and extraction sources, not the V2 source of
  truth.
- New packets and replans follow
  [slug-v2-plan-authoring-guide.md](./slug-v2-plan-authoring-guide.md): name
  learned facts, decisions and non-decisions, exact/Slug-native/deferred
  classification, natural producer ownership, request/revision behavior,
  memory lifetime, upstream tests, fallback deletion, scope, and stops.

## Current Milestone Overlay

Stages are ownership boundaries, not execution order. Preserve
**M7A → M8 → cache library release → M7B → M9**. Linux self-hosting is the first
product milestone. Establish the graph-independent cache core within demanded
M7A execution work; standalone packaging, direct Bazel disk-cache compatibility,
C/Python bindings and mixed-language breadth are post-bootstrap work.
Exact Bazel ActionKeys do not gate functional action admission or self-hosting.
Preserve accepted exact fields, complete semantic identity/invalidation and
exact REAPI/CAS digests; classify each unadmitted inspection field explicitly.
The finite bootstrap readiness matrix owns the
capability-to-target/evidence mapping. Stage 10 comparison uses ordinary graph
owners; no bootstrap-only path, precomputed runtime graph or hidden Cargo/Bazel
executor is admitted.

| 10 | [10-bazel-build-and-bootstrap.md](./slug-v2-subplans/10-bazel-build-and-bootstrap.md) | Bazel developer graph may start now; self-hosting follows classified aquery comparison and execution | Bazel 9 builds/tests Slug through BuildBuddy, then Slug reaches a stage1/stage2 self-build fixed point. |
| 11 | [11-bazel-compatible-cache-library.md](./slug-v2-subplans/11-bazel-compatible-cache-library.md) | Core boundary with M7A execution; standalone release after M8 | Slug consumes a graph-independent cache core; external Rust applications share remote and Bazel disk caches. |

## Supporting contracts

- [DICE ownership](../../../docs/developers/dice.md) owns runtime invariants.
- [Stage 9](./slug-v2-subplans/09-v1-extraction-ledger.md) owns retained reuse
  decisions; V1 is archival reference only.
- [Adoption roadmap](./slug-v2-subplans/zabel-adoption-roadmap.md) supplies
  bounded future work, not an alternate scheduler or Bazel compatibility oracle.
- [Plan history](./plan-history.md) preserves original acceptance inventories,
  source audits, and rejected experiments at immutable Git revisions.

Future branding consideration: Rubin (Red Rubin basil) remains a product
choice outside implementation milestones.
