# Slug V2 Clean-Restart Implementation Plan

## Canonical Status

This is the canonical Slug implementation plan after the V1 archive decision.
The January roadmap and numbered V1 subplans remain valuable reference material,
but new implementation work should start from this plan and the V2 subplans
under [slug-v2-subplans](./slug-v2-subplans/).

Slug keeps its name and repository. The current implementation is V1: a Buck2
fork migrated toward Bazel compatibility. V2 keeps the proven lessons and
selected code from V1, but the active trunk is a Bazel-shaped Rust
implementation from the first architectural boundary.

## Operating Decision

Use the existing repository for continuity, but restart the implementation
shape:

1. Preserve V1 through a tag and archive branch before root-level replacement.
2. Keep V1 source as extraction/reference material, not as the default build
   graph for V2.
3. Build V2 around Bazel 9+ semantics, Bazel source/test oracle fixtures, DICE,
   starlark-rust, and REAPI-first execution.
4. Import V1 code only after a small oracle fixture or focused regression proves
   the behavior matches the V2 boundary.

Do not physically move the whole V1 tree into `v1-archive/` unless the tag and
branch archive is not enough. A full in-tree archive makes search, codegraph
indexing, and new-agent orientation worse. If a physical archive is required,
exclude it from active build metadata and codegraph indexing.

## 2026-06-29 Branch Review And Remediation Gate

Review of `codex/slugv2` found that the clean-restart archive sequence has not
actually been completed in this checkout:

- `scripts/v2_archive_status.sh` fails because `slug-v1-archive` and
  `v1-archive` are missing, even though Stage 0 docs recorded them.
- `codex/slugv2` adds V2 scaffolding on top of the full V1 root instead of
  resetting the active tree into a clean V2 root. Relative to `main`, the branch
  adds hundreds of files and no root cleanup.
- `Cargo.toml` still includes the V1 `app/slug*` workspace members beside the
  new `app/slug_*_v2` crates, and the active tree still tracks V1-heavy paths
  such as `app/`, `buck2/`, `prelude/`, and `tests/`.
- A focused V2 compile check passed for the new crates, so the branch is useful
  as a prototype and selective patch source, but it is not the V2 trunk shape.

Do not merge or promote the current `codex/slugv2` branch wholesale as the clean
restart. Before implementation proceeds as V2 trunk, do this sequence:

1. Freeze new feature work on the mixed-root branch.
2. Pick the V1 preservation commit from the live checkout, verify the worktree
   state, then create and validate the `slug-v1-archive` tag and `v1-archive`
   branch.
3. Start the active V2 line from a clean root worktree: keep root pointers,
   V2 plans, and intentionally retained infrastructure; remove V1-only source,
   tests, Buck-shaped metadata, and V1 workspace members from the active build.
4. Re-import from `codex/slugv2` one bounded stage at a time. Each import needs
   an owner subplan, an oracle fixture or Bazel source citation, focused
   validation, and a Stage 9 extraction-ledger entry when it came from V1 or
   from the mixed-root prototype.
5. Run `scripts/v2_archive_status.sh`, `git diff --check`, and the touched
   stage validation before calling the root clean.

[thoughts/shared/prompts/2026-06-29-slug-v2-generic-implementer.md](../prompts/2026-06-29-slug-v2-generic-implementer.md)
for sessions that continue this remediation.

2026-06-29 execution update: the missing local archive refs have been repaired;
`slug-v1-archive^{commit}` and `v1-archive` now both resolve to
`e218054d4c796655939b968d90208b185decb352`. Cargo root metadata now exposes only
V2 app crates as active `app/slug_*` workspace members/dependencies, with V1
app crates removed from that surface. The branch still tracks V1 source/test
paths, and `remote_execution` is only a Stage 7 source candidate until its V1
crate dependencies are wrapped or ported away. The next Stage 0 task is
physical source/test cleanup or codegraph/build exclusions before importing
more prototype code.

## Non-Negotiables

- Bazel 9+ only. No pre-Bazel-9 behavior, no WORKSPACE support, and no legacy
  toolchain-resolution compatibility.
- Bazel source and Bazel tests are the compliance oracle. A parity claim needs
  a local Bazel source citation or an oracle fixture result.
- DICE owns semantic build state. Do not hide semantic discovery inside
  synchronous Starlark-visible APIs.
- REAPI is the execution boundary. Local execution is useful only as a REAPI
  service backend, with NativeLink first and actiond optional behind the same
  boundary.
- V2 output layout targets Bazel-shaped paths. Any deliberate Slug-specific
  divergence must be explicitly documented as an extension, not assumed.
- V1 plans and code are evidence and extraction sources, not the V2 source of
  truth.

## V1 Material Worth Keeping

Preserve and mine these V1 surfaces:

- DICE-owned bzlmod/replay implementation and tests in `app/slug_bzlmod` and
  `tests/core/bzlmod/test_plan61_guardrails.py`.
- REAPI/NativeLink smoke tests, what-ran evidence, upload/materialization
  checks, and remote action-cache tests from Plans 31 and 34.
- Bazel Starlark API work: `rule(implementation=...)`, `attr.*`, providers,
  depset probes, `ctx.actions`, and selected `cc_common` or `proto_common`
  compatibility surfaces.
- Repository-rule and module-extension lessons, especially lockfile replay,
  repo mapping, watched inputs, and materialization guardrails.
- Plan docs as a bug database for known semantic traps.

Do not import these V1 surfaces without redesign:

- Buck cell identity and fallback cell graph machinery.
- `buck-out` or Buck-shaped output-root assumptions.
- Direct-local executor shortcuts used as compatibility proof.
- Process-global semantic registries, hidden bridges, or fallback scanners that
  bypass DICE ownership.
- BXL or other Buck-derived user surfaces unless deliberately scoped as Slug
  extensions after Bazel compatibility is stable.

## First Commit Scope

The first V2 implementation commit is documentation and ownership only:

- mark this plan as canonical;
- preserve the V1 roadmap as archive/reference;
- create the V2 subplans;
- update `AGENTS.md` so future workers read this plan first;
- avoid moving source code until the V1 archive tag/branch and V2 root policy
  are explicit.

Do not mix source movement, root reset, or implementation code into this commit.

## Validation

For documentation-only changes:

```bash
git diff --check -- AGENTS.md README.md thoughts/shared/plans
```

For the first real implementation slice, use the validation command in that
slice's subplan and record compact evidence in the owning V2 plan.

## Next Agent Prompt

Use
[thoughts/shared/prompts/2026-06-29-slug-v2-generic-implementer.md](../prompts/2026-06-29-slug-v2-generic-implementer.md)
for implementation sessions. The split-specific remediation instructions live
in this plan, Stage 0, Stage 9, and `V1_ARCHIVE.md`, not in the prompt.
