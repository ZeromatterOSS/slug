# Slug V2 Clean-Restart Implementation Plan

## Canonical Status

This is the canonical Slug implementation plan after the V1 archive decision.
The January roadmap and numbered V1 subplans remain valuable reference material,
but new implementation work should start from this plan and the V2 subplans
under [slug-v2-subplans](./slug-v2-subplans/).

Slug keeps its name and repository. The current implementation is V1: a Buck2
fork migrated toward Bazel compatibility. V2 keeps the proven lessons and
selected code from V1, but the active trunk is a Bazel-shaped Rust
implementation from the first architectural boundary.

## Operating Decision

Use the existing repository for continuity, but restart the implementation
shape:

1. Preserve V1 through a tag and archive branch before root-level replacement.
2. Keep V1 source as extraction/reference material, not as the default build
   graph for V2.
3. Build V2 around Bazel 9+ semantics, Bazel source/test oracle fixtures, DICE,
   starlark-rust, and REAPI-first execution.
4. Import V1 code only after a small oracle fixture or focused regression proves
   the behavior matches the V2 boundary.

Do not physically move the whole V1 tree into `v1-archive/` unless the tag and
branch archive is not enough. A full in-tree archive makes search, codegraph
indexing, and new-agent orientation worse. If a physical archive is required,
exclude it from active build metadata and codegraph indexing.

## Non-Negotiables

- Bazel 9+ only. No pre-Bazel-9 behavior, no WORKSPACE support, and no legacy
  toolchain-resolution compatibility.
- Bazel source and Bazel tests are the compliance oracle. A parity claim needs
  a local Bazel source citation or an oracle fixture result.
- DICE owns semantic build state. Do not hide semantic discovery inside
  synchronous Starlark-visible APIs.
- REAPI is the execution boundary. Local execution is useful only as a REAPI
  service backend, with NativeLink first and actiond optional behind the same
  boundary.
- V2 output layout targets Bazel-shaped paths. Any deliberate Slug-specific
  divergence must be explicitly documented as an extension, not assumed.
- V1 plans and code are evidence and extraction sources, not the V2 source of
  truth.

## V1 Material Worth Keeping

Preserve and mine these V1 surfaces:

- DICE-owned bzlmod/replay implementation and tests in `app/slug_bzlmod` and
  `tests/core/bzlmod/test_plan61_guardrails.py`.
- REAPI/NativeLink smoke tests, what-ran evidence, upload/materialization
  checks, and remote action-cache tests from Plans 31 and 34.
- Bazel Starlark API work: `rule(implementation=...)`, `attr.*`, providers,
  depset probes, `ctx.actions`, and selected `cc_common` or `proto_common`
  compatibility surfaces.
- Repository-rule and module-extension lessons, especially lockfile replay,
  repo mapping, watched inputs, and materialization guardrails.
- Plan docs as a bug database for known semantic traps.

Do not import these V1 surfaces without redesign:

- Buck cell identity and fallback cell graph machinery.
- `buck-out` or Buck-shaped output-root assumptions.
- Direct-local executor shortcuts used as compatibility proof.
- Process-global semantic registries, hidden bridges, or fallback scanners that
  bypass DICE ownership.
- BXL or other Buck-derived user surfaces unless deliberately scoped as Slug
  extensions after Bazel compatibility is stable.

## First Commit Scope

The first V2 implementation commit is documentation and ownership only:

- mark this plan as canonical;
- preserve the V1 roadmap as archive/reference;
- create the V2 subplans;
- update `AGENTS.md` so future workers read this plan first;
- avoid moving source code until the V1 archive tag/branch and V2 root policy
  are explicit.

Do not mix source movement, root reset, or implementation code into this commit.

## Validation

For documentation-only changes:

```bash
git diff --check -- AGENTS.md README.md thoughts/shared/plans
```

For the first real implementation slice, use the validation command in that
slice's subplan and record compact evidence in the owning V2 plan.

## Next Agent Prompt

```text
Read AGENTS.md and thoughts/shared/plans/2026-06-26-slug-v2-clean-restart.md.
Treat the January roadmap and numbered V1 subplans as archive/reference only.
Do not edit V1 implementation code unless the current V2 subplan says to
extract or compare it. Start with Stage 0: preserve the current V1 line with a
tag/archive branch, then prepare the clean V2 root without physically moving the
entire V1 tree into the active source path. Keep the commit docs-only unless the
user explicitly asks to begin source movement.
```
